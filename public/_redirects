# Netlify Redirects File
# ----------------------
# This file tells Netlify how to handle routing for your app.
# React (and other SPAs) use client-side routing, so refreshing on /about or /products/123
# would normally cause a 404 because Netlify looks for a physical file at that path.
# The rule below forces Netlify to serve index.html for ALL routes,
# allowing React Router to take over and render the correct page.

/*    /index.html   200
