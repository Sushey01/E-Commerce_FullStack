# Netlify Headers File
# --------------------
# This file tells Netlify to serve JavaScript files with the correct MIME type.
# Without this, browsers may reject your bundled JS with an error like:
# "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module but server responded with application/octet-stream."
# The rule below ensures all .js files are served as application/javascript.
